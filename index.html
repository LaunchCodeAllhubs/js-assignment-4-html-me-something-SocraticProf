                     Part of the fun of teaching or taking an introduction to philosophy class is engaging with initially simple questions that prove to actually be really complicated. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     One such question that you might encounter in such an introduction to philosophy course is the following:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>How many objects are in this picture?</strong>
                  </p>
               </div>

               <div>
                  <img id="car" src="./Images/Lego-Car.jpg" alt="Red, white, and blue LEGO racecar on a black background.">

               </div>

               <h2>The Intuitive Answer</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
               <p>
                  The intutive answer is that there is one thing in the picture. There is one LEGO&reg; racecar. Unsurprisingly, many philosophers reject this ituitive answer.</p>
               <p>
                  To understand why, consider the following three pictures, and for each, ask yourself <strong>"how many things are in this picture?"</strong>
               </p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="primary-horiz">
            <img src="./Images/Lego-Car-Two-Pieces.jpg" alt="Red, white, and blue LEGO racecar with a part removed.">
            <img src="./Images/Lego-Pile.jpg" alt="A pile a LEGO pieces on a black background.">
            <img src="./Images/Lego-Scattered.jpg" alt="LEGO pieces scattered across a black background.">
         </div>
         <div class="text">
            <p>
              For each photo, there is a range of possible, perfectly reasonable, answers to our question. One could say that the leftmost image has two things in it. Alternatively, one could also answer that it has the same car, it is just in two parts. When we take our vehicle to the mechanic, we don't believe that our car ceases to exist when parts are removed and worked on and then magically starts existing again once those parts are put back together. It's still one car, but now in two parts.  
            </p>
            <p>
               But the same does not seem to apply to the middle photo. One might say that there is still only one thing in the photo, namely a pile of LEGO&reg; pieces. But it also seems acceptable to say that there are many things piled together instead of insisting that it is just one pile.  
            </p>
            <p>
               And it is clear that there are many things in the final picture. It is rare that anyone would assert that the pile or the car still exists in the rightmost picture. Instead, there are only individual bricks.

               <h2>The Nihilist Answer</h2>
            </div>

                     One particularly counterintuive approach to our question is that of the mereological nihilist. The nihilist thesis is a simple one: <em>There are no composite objects.</em> There is no pile. There is no racecar. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The typical merological nihilist asserts a few things to be true. First, there are things that exist called merological atoms. These are the fundamental parts of the universe and they do not have any parts. These parts might be quarks or gluons or stings or whatever else physicists happen to discover our universe is made up of. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Secondly, the typical mereological nihilist believes that there are no procedures for taking merological atoms and making some composite object out of them. Merological atoms can be arranged in different ways, but those arrangements don't magically bring a new object into existence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Finally, the typical mereological nihilist believes we should not double count objects. Let's imagine that LEGO&reg; bricks are mereological atoms, and let's stipulate that there are fifty bricks in each of our pictures. In our last picture, we have fifty such bricks, so there are fifty things in the picture. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     But there are also fifty bricks in the first picture. Should we say that there are fifty-one things in the first picture, the fifty bricks <strong>plus</strong> the car? Or should we say there are fifty-three things, the fifty bricks <strong>plus</strong> the car <strong>plus</strong> the two car parts from the second picture?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The merological nihilist says <strong>no!</strong> There are only the fifty bricks arranged or arranged as a car, but there is no new object that comes into existence.
