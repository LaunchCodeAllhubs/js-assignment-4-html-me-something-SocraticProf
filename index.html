                     Part of the fun of teaching or taking an introduction to philosophy class is engaging with initially simple questions that prove to actually be really complicated. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     One such question that you might encounter in such an introduction to philosophy course is the following:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>How many objects are in this picture?</strong>
                  </p>
               </div>

               <div>
                  <img id="car" src="./Images/Lego-Car.jpg" alt="Red, white, and blue LEGO racecar on a black background.">

               </div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="primary-vert">
            <div>
               <h2>The Intuitive Answer</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
               <p>
                  The intutive answer is that there is one thing in the picture. There is one LEGO&reg; racecar. Unsurprisingly, many philosophers reject this ituitive answer.</p>
               <p>
                  To understand why, consider the following three pictures, and for each, ask yourself <strong>"how many things are in this picture?"</strong>
               </p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="primary-horiz">
            <img src="./Images/Lego-Car-Two-Pieces.jpg" alt="Red, white, and blue LEGO racecar with a part removed.">
            <img src="./Images/Lego-Pile.jpg" alt="A pile a LEGO pieces on a black background.">
            <img src="./Images/Lego-Scattered.jpg" alt="LEGO pieces scattered across a black background.">
         </div>
         <div class="text">
            <p>
              For each photo, there are a range of possible, perfectly reasonable, answers to our question. One could say that the leftmost image has two things in it. Alternatively, one could also answer that it has the same car, it is just in two parts. When we take our vehicle to the mechanic, we don't believe that our car ceases to exist when parts are removed and worked on. It's still one car, but now in two parts.  
            </p>
            <p>
               But the same does not seem to apply to the middle photo. One might say that there is still only one thing in the photo, namely a pile of LEGO&reg; pieces. But it also seems acceptable to say that there are many things piled together instead of insisting that it is just one pile.  
            </p>
            <p>
               And it is clear that there are many things in the final picture. It is rare that anyone would assert that the pile or the car still exists in the rightmost picture. Instead, there are only individual bricks.
